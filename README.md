# Archipelago Manual for Super Street Fighter 2

## Welcome!
Welcome to the official repository for the Archipelago integration manual for Super Street Fighter 2. This manual is part of a community-driven effort to enhance the gaming experience by linking various elements and goals across games in the Archipelago system.

## Project Status
This project has completed its **Alpha** phase and is now in **Beta**. It is functional with many optimizations and additional features underway. Your feedback and contributions are still highly valued as they help further improve the manual and fix potential issues.

## Current Features
- **Arcade Mode Completion**: Players must complete the arcade modes for all characters.
- **Token Completion**: Players collect tokens to complete the game.

## Patch Notes
### Version 0.1.0
- Removal of the "Character Battles" goal.
- Addition of the "SFtoken" goal and item.
- Change of the filler item to "bandage".
- Addition of various checks.

### Version 0.0.1
- Initial alpha release.
- Functionality in place but pending optimization.

## Future Projects
- **Difficulty Settings**: Allow players to choose whether to activate difficulty restrictions during seed generation.
- **Other Game Modes**: I would like to add other game modes to introduce new checks and possibly make them unlockable items.
- **Other Goals**: I am trying to think of other types of goals to vary the fun.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from everyone. Here are a few ways you can help:
- **Feedback**: Play through the scenarios and leave feedback on gameplay and manual instructions.
- **Code Contributions**: Submit pull requests with bug fixes or feature suggestions.
- **Documentation**: Help improve this README or add other documentation.
